Anomander Rake,"Anomander Rake was the Lord of Moon's Spawn and later Black Coral, Son of Darkness, Knight of High House Dark and the leader of the Tiste Andii. He was said to be ""seated on the Throne of Sorrow""; a reflection of the loss and apathy his people had suffered.
<p>Anomander was <a href=""/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen#Soletaken_and_D&#39;ivers"" title=""Malazan Book of the Fallen"">Soletaken</a>, able to assume the form of a huge black dragon, presumably due to his drinking of the blood of Tiam, a true Eleint.
As a mage he made use of the Elder Warren of Kurald Galain. It is alluded in Gardens of the Moon and The Crippled God that had he wanted it, he could've destroyed every mage and High Mage at the Siege of Pale. 
He was one of the three chosen sons of Mother Dark, and her most favored. His brothers were Silchas Ruin and Andarist.
Anomander Rake carried an enormous sword on his back. The sword was called Dragnipur, taken from its creator, the Elder God Draconus by Anomander Rake, who then turned it upon its creator.
T'riss was a one-time companion, as were Lady Envy and Caladan Brood.
